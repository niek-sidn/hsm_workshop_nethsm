We would like to invite you to take a look at one of our other ptojects: **Stiab**  
*Get a complete, DNS-root to resolver, DNSSEC signing setup running on your laptop, ready for all your testing needs.*  
All by running one single `docker compose up -d --build`  
* A lot of what you learned here is actually applied in it.  
* And yes, you can be a contributor :-)
